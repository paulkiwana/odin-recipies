        <h2>Home made roast beef</h2>
        <p>You can't beat this English roast! It's got a blend of flavors you'd never expect. This roast has become a favorite of my historical interpreter friends.</p>
   <h2>Ingredients</h2>
   <ul>
   <li> 5 pounds beef round roast</li>

<li>salt and pepper to taste</li>

<li>2 tablespoons butter</li>

<li>½ cup water</li>

<li>1 medium onion, sliced (Optional)</li>

<li>1 clove garlic, minced (Optional)</li>

<li>½ teaspoon dried sage</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Steps</h2>
   <ol>
   <li> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>

<li>Make the pot roast: Season roast all over with salt and pepper.</li>

<li>Melt butter in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Brown roast on all sides in the butter, 6 to 8 minutes. Add water, onion, and garlic around the roast, then sprinkle sage, mint, seasoning salt, and pepper flakes over top.</li>

<li>Cover the pot and transfer to the preheated oven. Bake until tender and cooked through, about 2 hours for rare or 3 for well-done. Remove from the oven; transfer roast to another pan and keep warm. Set aside pan drippings for the gravy.</li>

<li>Make the gravy: Melt butter in a medium skillet over medium heat. Whisk in flour until smooth. Remove from the heat and add cold water; whisk until a smooth paste is formed.</li>

<li>Return to the stovetop over medium heat. Stir in sage and mint, then pour in pan drippings. Boil, stirring constantly, until gravy is thickened.</li>

<li>Slice the roast and serve with gravy poured over top.
   </ol>
